### Step 4: Exercise: dplyr

#### Choose 1: Manipulating Data with dplyr
This exercise teaches for verbs of dplyr: select(), filter(), arrange(), mutate() and summarize().

#### Choose 2: Grouping and Chaining with dplyr
This exercise takes an in-depth look at summarize(). A powerful verb allows split-apply-combine strategy of data analysis.

Good luck!
