Homework, Session 4: Tidy Data
================

We will be using Swirl for learning how to tidy data using tidyr package
-----

#### Note: The exercise uses gather() for converting data to Tidy format. In the session, we used pivot_longer(), which is a more powerful and newer version of gather().   

#### Thus the current exercise not only allows you to learn a new way of generating Tidy data, but will teach you to experiment with new functions, a necessary skill in data analysis!
***

### Step 1: Load Swirl

``` r
library("swirl")
```

### Step 2: (Skip if you did the exercise for Session 3) Install Swirl 'Getting and Cleaning Data' course using the following command:

``` r
install_course("Getting and Cleaning Data")
```

### Step 3: Start Swirl

``` r
swirl()
```

### Step 4: Choose 'Tidying Data with tidyr' exercise

Good luck!
