Homework, Session 2: Dataframe
================

We will again be using Swirl for practicing subsetting of data and tidyverse
-----

There are in total four exercises. Try to have patience and finish them slowly. They will be well worth the effort! 

### Start Swirl

``` r
library("swirl")
swirl()
```

##### Exercise 1 - 3 cover topic 3 - 8 from 'R programming course'

### Exercise 1: Refresh vectors and subsetting

#### Choose 3: Sequences of Numbers, 4: Vectors, 5: Missing Values, 6: Subsetting Vectors 

Part of R programming course

### Exercise 2: Refresh Logicical operations

#### Choose 8: Logic 

Part of R programming course

### Exercise 3: Refresh Data Frames

#### Choose 7: Matrices and Data Frames 

Part of R programming course. The exercise introduces matrices, which we didn't cover in detail. 
##### Matrices and data frame differ in one important aspect. 
Matrices can hold only one data type (eg. only numerical, or only character).
Data frame can hold multiple data types, and are more useful to data analysis.
In R, you will mostly be working with data frames.
