Good luck!


Bonus exercise for ggplot needs you to watch two YouTube videos!
-----

### Note: The course goes much deeper into ggplot than we did in the session. It would be good to put the effort to go through the course and it will teach you (almost) everything you need to know about ggplot.  

You will be watching a beginner's course on ggplot conducted by [Thomas Lin Pedersen](https://github.com/thomasp85), member of RStudio and TidyR packages.

With each video, you can code along the exercises he proposes.

Good luck!
