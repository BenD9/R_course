Homework, Session 5: ggplot
================

### Step 1: Load Swirl

``` r
library("swirl")
```

### Step 2: Install Swirl 'Exploratory Data Analysis' course using the following command:

``` r
install_course("Exploratory Data Analysis")
```

### Step 3: Start Swirl

``` r
swirl()
```

### Step 4: Go through Exercise 8 - 10 based on GGPlot2 

When starting 'Lesson 8: GGPlot2 Part1', Swirl asks a few questions about base R and lattice graphics, which are not really required if you master ggplot. Thus, we did not cover these in the session. The philosophy of starting with ggplot instead of base graphics is presented here: [Don't teach built-in plotting to beginners (teach ggplot2)](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach_ggplot2_to_beginners/)

The answer to the questions are:  
*Recall what you know about R's base plotting system. Which of the following does NOT apply to it?*  
Can easily go back once the plot has started (e.g., to adjust margins or correct a typo)

*Recall what you know about R's lattice plotting system. Which of the following does NOT apply to it?*  
Can always add to the plot once it is created

*If we told you that ggplot2 combines the best of base and lattice, that would mean it ...?*   
All of the others

Good luck!

You can also view a lot of ggplots along with code at [R Graph Catalog](http://shiny.stat.ubc.ca/r-graph-catalog/)

***
Bonus exercise for ggplot needs you to watch two YouTube videos!

### Note: The course goes much deeper into ggplot than we did in the session. It would be good to put the effort to go through the course and it will teach you (almost) everything you need to know about ggplot.  

You will be watching a beginner's course on ggplot conducted by [Thomas Lin Pedersen](https://github.com/thomasp85), member of RStudio and TidyR packages.

With each video, you can code along the exercises he proposes.

Good luck!
