### For the second session, we will introduce 2-Dimensional data structures called data.frames

We will learn how to subset and manipulate them. 

#### For manipulating data.frames, we will use [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)

### Install tidyverse using the following command:

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Once installed, load tidyverse packages into the R session using the command:

```r
library(tidyverse)
```

Tidyverse is a collection of packages that help with data manipulation. To see, which packages come with the installtion, use the following command

```r
tidyverse_packages()
```

You should see the following image on your R console. Check that **dplyr** package is included in the installation.
