### Deploying the project on RStudio Cloud

If you have issues installing packages on RStudio on your computer, you can follow the course using [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/).

For this, go to the RStudio Cloud project page for this course: <https://rstudio.cloud/project/1172996> 

You can either LogIn using Google / Github credentials, or open a new account. 

Once you LogIn, you should see the Workspace for the project opening up on your browser. **Note that this is a temporary project and not permanently imported into your Cloud workspace**. To import the project into your personal workspace, click on 'Save a Permanent Copy' button in the top panel. 

The RStudio Cloud has same folder structure as the GitHub directory and can be used to locate files and images.
